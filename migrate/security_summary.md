# üîí NovaCRM Security Overview

## üéØ Security Principles

**Our Goal**: Build a CRM that clients can trust with their business data.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege** - Users only access what they need
3. **Zero Trust** - Verify everything, trust nothing
4. **Transparency** - Be clear about what we collect and protect

## üõ°Ô∏è Essential Security Components

### 1. **Authentication (Who Are You?)**

#### What We Need
- **Secure Login System**
  - Email/password with strong requirements
  - OAuth options (Google, Microsoft)
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA)
  - Remember me (but securely)
  - Account lockout after failed attempts

- **Session Management**
  - Secure session tokens
  - Automatic timeout for inactivity
  - "Log out everywhere" option
  - Device tracking

- **Password Security**
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Complexity requirements
  - Password history (can't reuse)
  - Secure reset process
  - No passwords in emails

### 2. **Authorization (What Can You Do?)**

#### Role-Based Access
- **Owner** - Full control, billing, delete account
- **Admin** - Manage users, settings, all data
- **Member** - Create/edit contacts and tasks
- **Viewer** - Read-only access

#### Permission Examples
- Only Owners can access billing
- Only Admins can invite new users
- Members can't delete other people's contacts
- Viewers can't export data

### 3. **API Security**

#### API Keys
- **What They're For**
  - Integrations (Zapier, webhooks)
  - Mobile apps
  - Custom development

- **Key Features Needed**
  - Unique keys per integration
  - Can revoke anytime
  - Track usage per key
  - Set expiration dates
  - Limit permissions per key

#### Rate Limiting
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage

- **Different Limits For**
  - Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
  - API calls: 100 per minute (normal use)
  - File uploads: 10 per hour
  - Public pages: 30 per minute
  - Email sending: 50 per hour

### 4. **Data Protection**

#### What Needs Encryption
- **At Rest** (stored data)
  - Passwords (hashed, not encrypted)
  - API keys
  - Sensitive custom fields
  - File attachments
  - Backup data

- **In Transit** (moving data)
  - All API calls (HTTPS only)
  - File uploads/downloads
  - Email communications
  - Webhook payloads

#### Data Privacy
- **PII Protection**
  - Mask sensitive data in logs
  - Anonymize data for analytics
  - Right to be forgotten (GDPR)
  - Data export for users

### 5. **Infrastructure Security**

#### Application Security
- **Input Validation**
  - Sanitize all user inputs
  - Prevent SQL injection
  - Stop XSS attacks
  - Block malicious files

- **Security Headers**
  - Content Security Policy
  - X-Frame-Options
  - HSTS (force HTTPS)
  - No cache for sensitive pages

#### Monitoring & Alerts
- **What to Monitor**
  - Failed login attempts
  - API usage spikes
  - New device logins
  - Permission changes
  - Data exports

- **Alert Triggers**
  - Multiple failed logins
  - Login from new country
  - Bulk data operations
  - API key compromise

### 6. **Compliance & Policies**

#### Legal Requirements
- **GDPR** (Europe)
  - User consent tracking
  - Data portability
  - Right to deletion
  - Privacy policy

- **CCPA** (California)
  - Do not sell data
  - Opt-out mechanisms
  - Data disclosure

#### Security Policies
- **For Your Team**
  - Access review quarterly
  - Password rotation
  - Security training
  - Incident response plan

- **For Users**
  - Terms of Service
  - Privacy Policy
  - Acceptable Use Policy
  - Data Processing Agreement

## üö® Security Threats to Protect Against

### Common Attack Vectors
1. **Brute Force Attacks** ‚Üí Rate limiting + account lockout
2. **SQL Injection** ‚Üí Parameterized queries
3. **XSS Attacks** ‚Üí Input sanitization
4. **CSRF Attacks** ‚Üí CSRF tokens
5. **Man-in-the-Middle** ‚Üí HTTPS everywhere
6. **Session Hijacking** ‚Üí Secure session tokens
7. **API Abuse** ‚Üí Rate limiting + monitoring

### Data Breach Prevention
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Employee security training
- Incident response plan

## üéØ Security Impact on User Experience

### Good Security Should Be:
- **Invisible** - Users shouldn't think about it
- **Convenient** - Not annoying or blocking
- **Clear** - Explain why when you need something
- **Fast** - Security checks shouldn't slow things down

### Examples:
- ‚úÖ "Remember me" checkbox (convenient)
- ‚úÖ One-click Google login (fast)
- ‚úÖ Clear password requirements (helpful)
- ‚ùå CAPTCHA on every page (annoying)
- ‚ùå Logout every 5 minutes (frustrating)

## üîê Quick Wins for Security

### Easy to Implement, Big Impact
1. **Strong password requirements** - Prevents most breaches
2. **Rate limiting on login** - Stops brute force attacks
3. **HTTPS only** - Protects data in transit
4. **Activity notifications** - "New login from iPhone"
5. **API key rotation** - Limit damage from leaks
6. **Regular backups** - Recovery from any incident

---

## üìà Security Metrics to Track

### Key Indicators
- Failed login attempts per day
- API calls per user
- Average session duration
- Password reset requests
- New device logins
- Data export requests
- Security incident count

### Red Flags
- Spike in failed logins
- Unusual API patterns
- Multiple password resets
- Access from suspicious locations
- Bulk data exports

**Remember**: Security is not a feature you add later - it's the foundation you build on from day one. Start with the basics, then layer on more sophisticated protections as you grow.
