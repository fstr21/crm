ome background, i was oritgianlly using a laptop and desktop to work on my projects, i felt there was some compatability issues, especially with environments and mcp servers. So i was suggested to use docker, so all of the environrment will be contained, however earlier today i left my house ready to use my laptop to pull and get docker going but none of the mcp were working and i spent 2 hours trying to figure that out, since you have access to my whole project can yu please write me a detailed guide at how i can recreate the environment on my laptop 1:1 assuming i have python and docker and such but no crm folder or mcps in there
